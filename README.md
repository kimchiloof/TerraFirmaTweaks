TerraFirmaTweaks is a Minecraft 1.20.1 mod addon for [TerraFirmaCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmacraft), adding better compatibility with vanilla Minecraft and other mods. 

The aim is to be a (mostly) all-in-one solution to TerraFirmaCraft bugs and incompatibilities, while offering as much user customizations as possible. 

<h3>Why make TerraFirmaTweaks?</h3>

1. A lack of some configuration options in previous tweaks mods
2. Tweaks were found in many different mods, some overlapping
3. Some tweaks missing from 1.20.1 TFC
4. Just wanted to try out modding :)

Feel free to open new issues documenting problems or suggestions, and pull requests if you have some changes you'd like to see added! I will review them as I have time.

## Available options 
Note that **non**-configurable options (i.e., those without options in the config file or another easy config method) are in _italics_

## Recommended Additions

Don't see a mod that needs tweaking? Submit a suggestion issue or PR, or look to any of the following other compatibility mods:

- Immersive Engineering via [TFC + IE Crossover](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-ie-crossover) and [Advanced TFC Tech Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-tfc-tech-unofficial)
- Farmer's Delight via [Farmer's Delight TFC](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight-tfc)
- Small Ships via [TerraFirmaShips](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmaships)

Want more tweaks? 

- I highly recommended to download and use [Vexxed Visuals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/terrafirmacraft-vexxed-visuals) and the TerraFirmaTweaks built-in Vexxed Tweaks resource packs
- Use [Almost Unified](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/almost-unified) to hide duplicate ingots, etc. Read their wiki for more info on how.
    
## Installation

This mod requires:
- [Minecraft Forge](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.20.1/gettingstarted/)
- [TerraFirmaCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmacraft)
- [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) is not explictly required, but is highly recommended to offer a nice GUI config menu (a less preferred though still functional alternative can be Create's config menu or [Forge Config Screens](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge))

To install, simply download the mod from this Github repo, the [Curseforge]() page, or the [Modrinth]() page, and drop into your 'mods' folder.

---

‚öôÔ∏è **Note**: On the first game load where this mod is installed, all mixins are **disabled** as the config file is generated. 
- Most options' configs are set to enabled by default, so feel free to use the first load to disable any tweaks (especially if you have potentially incompatible mods)
- On game restart, all configs that are left as 'enabled' will be thereby enabled

‚öôÔ∏è If you would like to use [Wooden Cog](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wooden-cog)'s Create tweaks, you should:
1. Install both TerraFirmaTweaks and Wooden Cog
2. Run the game and **disable** all TerraFirmaTweak's Create options
3. Restart the game

---

üèóÔ∏è To build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimchiloof/TerraFirmaTweaks/
cd TerraFirmaTweaks
./gradlew build
```
