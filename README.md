TerraFirmaTweaks is a Minecraft 1.20.1 mod addon for [TerraFirmaCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmacraft), adding better compatibility with vanilla Minecraft, and various other mods. 

The aim is to be an all-in-one solution to TerraFirmaCraft bugs and incompatibilities, while offering as much user customizations as possible. 

Why make TerraFirmaTweaks? 
1. A lack of some configuration options in previous tweaks mods
2. Tweaks were found in many different mods, some overlapping
3. Some tweaks missing from 1.20.1 TFC
4. Just wanted to try out modding :)

Currently implemented mods include:
- [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create)

Currently implemented options include:
- TODO
